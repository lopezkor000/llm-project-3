Worst play I've ever seen.  And a total rip-off! What has happened to the theater? Lousy costumes. I didn't know this was a play. Well kids, this was supposed to be the part of the show where SpongeBob and I were gonna watch old outtakes  and rejected scenes and talk about 'em.  But he never showed up! And now I'm stuck in the belly of a whale! Oh well. We already paid for the airtime, so here they are.  Hello children. You know, like any great work of art, SpongeBob did not just appear out of nowhere. He started out as a thought.  Then he evolved into  a primitive rendering... And along the way  to becoming the sponge we all know and love,  he went through many different changes. And phases and phanges.  And change can be very painful. For instance,  did you know that SpongeBob was not the first choice to star in the show?  Hard to believe, I know. Watch these opening themes, and you'll see why he was eventually picked.

Then, as fate would have it, magical storm clouds move in, zapping both men with a neon-plaid lightning bolt and raining radioactive ooze, which, through centrifugal and electromagnetic turbulence, causes a powerful earthquake deep in the jungle two-thousand miles away, consequently unearthing a magical crystal with wings that flies to Ernie and Tim's exact location, and, powered by super gamma energy currents, pilots them to open skies until, not paying attention, the crystal clips the top of a billboard, flinging the two back to their apartment miraculously unharmed, when... Hey, the popcorn's ready! ...they proceed with movie night and eat slightly overcooked popcorn. Mmmm... Suddenly, an amazing reaction to the overcooked popcorn hits them with a jolt of cosmic super energy, metamorphosing Ernie into an incredibly strong, seastar-wearing superhero and Tim into a slightly less strong, but also super sailor-looking guy. I have the sudden and incredibly urge to breathe water instead of air. As do And that is how they became the superheroes we have come to know as...  Defenders of the Deep! Oh, feels just like yesterday, doesn't it, Mermaid Man? ...No, not really. Hmm... Oh, so what do you boys think?

And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action.

You know, it reminds me of something The satisfaction earnings of the fourth quarter of my lunch are off the charts! And I love the way it tastes! And business, my friend, is the business Well, one can't have business without business right? Interesting point, Marv. How's your sandwich? Absolutely spectacular! This new menu item is the business plan I can really get behind! I tell you, this is one dynamic little sandwich. With levels of proactiveness that are off the charts. It really appeals to my demographic. Well, you are an executive in a fast-paced world of business. Ha, ha! That's for sure!  Oh, yeah. They're a riot. What can I get ya? I guess I'll have one of these business sandwiches everybody's talking about. Ah, the executive treatment. Is that what you call it? Well, that's what Mr. Krabs makes me call it. It's really just a Krabby Patty that costs more. Oh, wow! I'll take seven! Oh, I'm sorry, sir. The executive treatment is available to executives only. But I never wanted anything so much in my whole life! Since this morning when I wanted a donut-night at the Donut and it was great! The donut is gone!  The donut is gone!  First of all, a lot of that donut, it's still on your face! Now, where's my executive treatment? I told you, it's for executives only! And you aren't even dressed like an executive! I could of course sell you  the official Will the tie let me order the executive treatment? Not on its own, no. But you could Krabby-size the tie with and get a pair of  business glasses for additional 10 dollars.  Well, I'd be stupid not to! Well, you're half right. Here's your 20 bucks. Here's your glasses.

What are you doing throwing away a perfectly sellable sandwich?! No!  No!  No!  Not 4-B! No! Wow! You're very upset about conference room 4-B. And I can't say I blame you. Because conference room 4-B is the most terrifying conference room in the whole building. More people have been fired in here than all the other conference rooms combined!  Save it for the big brainstorming meeting!  Right here is where all the biggest business decisions in the business are made. Why if an impostor were to be caught in here, hmm... He'd be given a sandwich and sent on his way? No, he'd be convicted as a corporate spy and sent to jail forever and ever and ever. Hey, where are you going? I think I’ve forgot to water my manatee I'll just--? Gentlemen, please.  Where am I? Exactly. I like you, young man. Everybody scoot down and so he can sit next to me. And I won't intimidate him at all by my terrifyingly largeness and proximity. As this junior executive so eloquently put it, “Where exactly are we?” Ah, sir, if you take a look at this  I believe you'll agree that we’re perfectly positioned for our marketing to be number one across the business sector. I need a straight answer, not a bunch of meaningless charts! What do you give a disappointed stockholder to make him feel better? A sandwich? Get a load of this guy! A sandwich! This guy has sandwiches on the brain!  No I don't! That's just about the silliest piece of idea! Alright, hold it! Now all of you just hold it right there! It's easy to laugh and judge and heap a man with scholar when you hear an idea that stands out because it's so unusual.  So, everybody, just stop and think for a minute about what your colleague is really trying to say because I want to be the one to tell him, That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard. What if I had a meaningless chart? Yes, maybe I was too hasty about that.  Well, you're definitely giving a new meaning to the word “meaningless”. Oh, wait!  And here's a little house with smoke coming out of the chimney. See what I mean?  I guess he likes my chart, 'cause he's smiling. He smiles like that when he's really angry. Do you slap your palms down on the table like that too?  Oh. I don't know who you are, but you better not be an impostor. Do you know what happens to impostors in conference room 4-B? Well, uh, let's see. Uh, don't tell me! I-I know it's not sandwiches. They don't get sandwiches. Do they?  Mister, this is the last straw!  Now, I'm just going to give you just 18 more chances to prove yourself. Montage. Jenkins! Yes, sir? Mustache. Here you are sir.  And so in conclusion, You know, kid. You do? For me to fire! Oh, yeah? Well, I’ve got a surprise for you.  You can't fire me! I'm not an executive at all! I'm just a guy who happens to like sandwiches! So, go ahead!

Thanks for the job, boss! That's real sweet, BrownPants, but   Neptune's son, what are you doing?  You aren't doing that on my building site! You're fired! I do not understand this. What is wrong with this city? Maybe it's not the city. Maybe it's me.  Hey, mister, Look at me! Mister, look at me! Is there something wrong with me? Listen up, y'all! You do? Yup, and it involves this.  So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob? You got it, SquidCakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find-- Sandy,  Oops, Mr. Squidward! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape! And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!  I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea. If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever. Ha! Is that your version of a threat? Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift. Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any–  Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!  Not so fast! Real drag, isn't it? Having to stand around the fire for warmth every night? Yeah. Heh, not for us... we're just waiting in line for a new video game. I guess I am just a jobless deadbeat.  You guys mind if I bubble?  You can't do that here! But... bubbles will steady the ol' nerves. Watch.  See? Do you have any...  I think we've made our point with the snapping!  As I was saying... do you have any idea who we are? Um, wait... err, um... don't tell me, um... Don't answer.  I'll show ya.  We call us the Bubble Poppin' Boys. And article one of our charter prohibits bubble blowing on our turf.  You see why we don't allow bubbles in our city?! Fortunately, we have ways of dealing with careless bubble blowers like you. Let's rough him up, boys! Where'd he go?  After him! Ah, You- you did it!  Do you realize what you've done? No. You have freed the city. Citzens of New Kelp, come out of the shadows, 'cause CheeseBoy kicked the Bubble Poppin' gang right out of town! Thank you, CheeseBoy! What an amazing gift Actually, it's Well, CheeseHead, this is a historic day for New Kelp City. You have rid this city of the Bubble Poppin' Boys, and restored bubble-blowing to the streets.  Something I wasn't able to do for 20 years as mayor. For this, I appoint you...  mayor of New Kelp City!  All hail mayor CheeseHead! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  Buddy? You there? SpongeBob!  Maybe someone at that truck stop has seen our porous little buddy. SpongeBob! There he is, guys! Huh? SpongeBob!  Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. That's not SpongeBob,  I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy!  You're safe now in my arms.  Huh? Where'd you go now? Uh, Pat? Oh. Now let's see what that little critter's up to.  New mayor of...  SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!  Citizens of New Kelp City. I don't know much about politics or balanced budgets or how to be a leader. I'm not exactly sure what a mayor…is. But I do know this, while I am wearing the mayor's hat, it will always be safe to blow bubbles on the streets of CheeseHead BrownPants? New Hang on a minute. I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here, but Bikini Bottom needs you back, What's that? Well, I'm sorry I yelled at you, buddy. Oh, this is a surprise. Surprised I found you? No, surprised at seeing a talking weasel.  It's me, Sandy. Don't pretend you don't remember me, Sorry, Sandy. But I'd probably remember another underwater, talking weasel. You may not remember the weasel, but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you? I have no idea how that got there. All I remember is hitting my head, blowing some bubbles and now, poof, You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back. Uh, sorry, weasel girl, I can't leave. These people need my leadership. In fact,  SpongeBob, wait! Don't just stand there, get in. Squidward? Hurry up!  Decorative egg, here Here it is! Nope. Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. I was a fry cook before? Aye, the best in the business. Look, guys, as much as I'd love to toil the days away flipping burgers, I think I'll just go back to my modest job as mayor of a major city. Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time!

Back in them days, the whole place was run by that no-good galoot, Dead Eye! Shoo-Wee! This place sure is big and fancy-like! Gee, willigers! They got an ice cream parlor!

WHO SAID THAT?  Well, last time I checked, this town was Dead Eye Gulch! Not Yokelburg!  then  Yokelburg...  Who are you anyway? I'm SpongeBuck, the new sheriff. Want some chili? Sheriff!  'Round these parts we call them coffin jockeys! Coffin jockeys!?  You didn't say anything about that!  That must be a new record for running off a sheriff.  Hope I haven't missed the first post.

Looks like the end of the trail. We're out of food,  water, and lip balm!  I'm sorry, old Paint! Guess I have to put you out your misery! So long, old friend! Hey, buddy, you better be careful. It does? Oh, don't listen to that guy, kid! He's looney! Oh, hey SpongeBuck! Those guys are a barrel of laughs, huh? But lazy! Anyway, you've got to get back and save the town, sheriff! I ain't no sheriff. Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton! Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend! That's me!  I don't know,  Ow! Okay, okay! I'll do it! Just stop hurtin' me! Besides, you're right! It's time I stepped up and looked him in the eye! So, I'll go back to Dead Eye Gulch, whip Plankton, and save the town at high noon! Hop on, buddy! Thanks, idiot friend! But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Don't worry. I got a short-cut. He-ya! Why are we going so fast? 'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs!  Great idea!  Okay, let's see,  personal possessions, clothes off your backs, that should about do it! Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank. I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance. Uh huh, waa-waa! Uh huh, waa-waa! I gotta admit, he's got skills. That's right! And when I take the deed to your saloon, Krabs, I'll own every building in town! And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives!  Swallowed a bug! I hate that. It totally ruins an evil laugh. Yee-how! So, that's it. We lost. I don't know how it could get any worse. Hi, guys! I'm back in the nick of time! We're heroes! You're morons! It's too late. Plankton's taken everything! But it's only 11:55. The final showdown always takes place at high noon. Well, And all our stuff. And me money! Me beautiful, beautiful money! You can't give up! Before I came here, I would've given up, too. But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, Could you get to the point? We're freezing! What I'm a saying is if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good! So, what do you say? Well, Forget it, SpongeBuck! Why are you all standing in your pajamas? No, don't tell me. Oh, I know! You're throwing a slumber party! Pillow fight! That pillow sure packs a wallop! It's made out of wood,  like all pillows in the old west. Round 2? I do believe Looks like it's just you and me, kid. Come on, guys! We can do this! If we work together! No offense, kid. I don't blame you for losing faith. I lost faith too. But then, I discovered the love of my new idiot friend. And we've come far. So I'm sure with all of us working together, in idiot friendship, we can beat Dead Eye and save the town! So let's huddle up and make a plan, together! Uh huh, Bzbzbzbzbzbzb Uh huh, uh huh, Bzbzbzbzbzbzbzbzb Uh, SpongeBuck, why do you keep saying bzbzbzbzbzbzb? Umm... You don't have a plan, do you? No. To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far.  But I know we can beat him! If we just work together! Oh, Dead Eye Plankton?! So, fry cook, you're back! You wish, Dead Eye! We are united! Right-- Hey! We're right behind you, boy! WAY, WAY behind you! So, it's come to this. Well, you can hold the mano, because it's come down to you and me! Well, well, well, look at the time! High noon!  Ow!  I hate all of you! Can I try? You can't do this! Three yee-haws for SpongeBuck! Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!  Ah! Ouch! Ooh! Take that, you no-good little varmint! I have a lot of money! Well, sheriff, you beat You forgot the most important part.  What's that? I discovered the power of idiot friendship. Come with me, Thank you, sheriff SpongeBuck for saving our town. History will vindicate me! We melted down Plankton's gold and made a statue in your honor. Oooh! I liked my design better. Sorry about the whole “tricking you into being sheriff” thing. And to make it up to you, Wow! Fry cook!  Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch! The statue is truly amazing! Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say 'Hey!

Honestly, I don't think anyone in Bikini Bottom would know a decent meal if it looked them right in the eye and said, Hello! I'm a decent meal, wonderful to meet you! Please pay money for me and then put me in your mouth so your old pal Plankton doesn't lose everything he's spent his entire life working for! Yeah, and if anyone ever did order one of your meals, it probably would look them in the eye. You know, Karen, sometimes I wonder if you're here to help me run the Chum Bucket or just to make me feel like Maybe in heels. If it wasn't for me, you probably wouldn't even remember to blink! Oh, come on! When we first met, you were little more than a jumbled mass of diodes and wires. I made you what you are today!  Literally! So don't think you couldn't be replaced in a heartbeat! Ow! What's the matter? My eye is burning and I don't know why! Blink.  Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Now where was I!? You were threatening to replace me. Oh yeah! I don't need you! I can make a whole army of computers that might actually help me steal the formula! Oh, puh-leeze. I'll show you woman! Oh, Karen! Now what!? Could you come here for a moment? What do you want? Feast your, uh, screen on this. That’s my replacement!? It’s a toaster! Ha ha ha, that, my dear, is a T-119A Compumatic, the finest of its kind. Good morning, sir. Good morning, T-119A! They're supposed to do that.  Next, behold! The Noxious Enterprises Super SPU-31 Liquid-Cooled Mobile Processing Unit, a mind staggering combination of both power!  And now, Karen, the piece de resistance.  Have you ever witnessed such marvelous machinery? It sorta just looks like an old hair dryer taped to the back of a miniature windmill. I can see how someone of your level of technical knowledge would think that, Karen, but in actuality what you are looking at is... oh, right. I don't recall you ever having reason to own a hair dryer, Okay, here we go! Are you going to make me get the picture down again!? What picture!? You see! Why are we even talking about this? Because you were the one that said— What's going on!? Dear Neptune! Karen, do something! Quick! They're tearing each other apart! Just press a button or something! Not that one! Well, it's good to see that that strategy didn't fall flat! You know, Karen, with you around, Ohhh, so it's my fault is it? That's right! Now it's all clear! It's you that's been holding me back! In fact, if it weren't for your constant stifling, I'd have the whole world running for the safety of their mommies! You and your crack team of robots, huh? Well maybe I could iron out a few bugs, but then you'll see just how much I need you!  Karen? What's this?  Dear Plankton, I've logged onto another network. I just can't go into sleep mode at night knowing that you'll continue blaming me for all of your failures. Anyway, you're a grown single celled organism, and allowed to make your own syntax errors. Nice knowing you, Karen. Dah! who needs her!? Not me! I'm going to steal that Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs once and for all. And then we'll see who's made the error.  Ow!  P.S., don't forget to blink. Okay, team, listen up. We're on our own now so we don't have anything holding us back. Now I know you all look upon me kindly since I am your creator, but the last thing the Chum Bucket needs is, if we're going to be victorious, is a bunch of soft, uh, software. Does everybody understand? I said, does everybody understand!? All right, then let's do this! T-119A to position!  SPU-31 to position! Command Module to position! Heh heh heh. Now let's see Krabs stop this. I'll show him. I'll show them all! This just in, a diabolical albeit haphazardly thrown-together machine is attacking Bikini Bottom and is headed straight for the Krusty Krab!

From those humble beginnings, Goofy Goober has grown into a multibillion dollar business  that you, our newest employee, now have the privilege to work for.

That's hot! Nothing's biting today. Newbie, why would you turn the heat on in the freezer? Oh, it was freezing in there, and the fire What?! Now, this should be easy for you.

Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today.  And you're right!  After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless.

What a diligent and charming individual. That's when I entered the back room to grab a new bun. Just as I was about to reach for one, I heard a slight creek, and that's when the chain snapped, and then, slam! My heroic and brave actions were halted by an unsafe shelf. Disoriented and in pain, I collapsed, and lay for nearly six hours crying softly for help.  Help! H-help! Help.  The worst part, though, is...is that Hmmm, I see.

Brad called in sick, so I guess Uh... Can I get one with extra string? Ugh.  What?  Hey, girl! Want to come over and make fun of boys or something? Uh, sorry, girl, I can't.  Oh! See ya later, How much is this choker? Um, it's a wrist band.   Nixie! My bestest friend in the whole wide world. You should come over. We can watch TV and eat cheese! I wish I could, Pearl, but I have to work at Dangles and Bangles. All dangles are half off with the purchase of any bangle. Dangle must be of equal or lesser value than bangle.

Now instead of wasting my precious money on your clothes and your school supplies...  I'll be an independent working woman, blazing my own trail and standing on my own two fins. That's the spirit. Oh, can I borrow $10? I'll miss you around the house. Oh, Daddy, you'll see me after work. I was talkin' to the money. Hey, Marina! You should meet the manager, I guess. He's in his office. Mr. Pepalino, there's someone here for a job. Ah!  Welcome to Scorched Coral. Please go away. Oh, hey, Pearl. What are you doing here? I would like to apply for a job, please. Yeah, sorry. You're a little late. We were hiring, but we actually just hired someone today. Ah! Oh, Nixie, I need to work at Dangles and Bangles! This is my last chance, you gotta help me out here! Oh, please, please, please, please, please! Come on, let me introduce you to the manager. Nope, not hiring. You don't understand. I have to work here! Sorry, missy, the only thing we don't dangle here... is hope. Oh, bangles. Ah...  Oh, this is the worst. If I don't get a job at the mall, I'm gonna have to hang out with my dad! You looking for a job, deary? Yeah! I need one as soon as possible. It's a life or death situation, actually. Oh, my goodness. Are you in danger? In danger of never seeing my friends 'cause Come with me.  Weird. I've never been in this part of the mall before.  Ugh! What's that smell? Oh, probably one of the many perfumes that we sell here at Grandma's Apron! Congratulations!  Oh, this is the best day of my life!  Ah!  Well, I can't quite afford to be picky these days. The only other employee besides me was Myrtle, and she's... no longer with us. Almost forget my shades! See ya later, suckers! Hey, Did you find a job? Yeah,  Pearl, you cannot be serious. Ew, that store is for old people.  Old people aren't that bad. Are they? Hey, girls. Well, we are having a sale on them. They're 25% off today. Um, isn't it your nap time, Pearl? Where's your muumuu, granny? Oh, don't let those bubble-headed nincompoops get to you, But it's not fair. Life's not fair, my dear. We all go through hard times at some point. Here, look. See? I was different from the other girls, and they teased me for it. They called me Boring Beatrice. Not very creative, those girls. Who would even take a picture of that? Oh, good ol' Jonesy from the AV Club took that one! Wait, but who took that picture-- All that matters, Pearly, my dear, is that things will soon change. But in the meantime, you should be having as much fun as possible. Whoa, come back here, yarn!  Love the shoes, You guys just don't get it. Being a grandma is fun. I get to sit in a rocking chair, dust tchotchkes, bake cookies, knit mittens, hats, and scarves. It's actually, like, the most coral store in the whole mall, so you can all just... just... eat barnacles! Now, now, girls. What are you gonna do about it, granny? Granny power! Power! Power! Pearl, toss me the Hi-ya! It smells like pills and bed pans. Whoa! Well, now that you're all sitting down, let me tell you about the first time I ever saw a talking picture show. Oh, boy, did they know how to talk. No, please! I can't take anymore! It's... so... boring! No, I hate the past! One hour later... And that's why today, we all wear shoes. Okay, okay, we get it, we will stop being mean, I promise, just let us go! Whoa! Listen, Pearl. We didn't mean to hurt your feelings or anything. We just, like, think it's weird that you're, like, a grandma now, or whatever. Well, I don't care what you think anymore anyway. I'm being true to myself, and--and that's all that matters! Eh. I'm a grandma now. Right, Beatrice? Oh, Pearl, I'm so glad you enjoy being a grandma, but your friends make a good point. You're only young once, you see. You don't want to grow up too fast or you'll miss out on all the fun. I guess you're right. Being a grandma is nice and all, but Go have yourself some fun, my dear. Ah, ah, ah, ah.

But it's not an ordinary special,  because today we go to Encino, California, as it was…  …one hundred million years ago! So prepare yourself for…  SpongeBob SquarePants B.C.!  With your host, Patchy the Pirate! Yee-ha! Hey kids! Now, you're probably wondering, Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave? good question, you little...  Well, it's because today's SpongeBob takes place in prehistoric times  ...back when man struggled for survival  and dinosaurs ruled the Earth.  Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding YOU now!  Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest.  It was a simpler time  with simpler pleasures!  Your clothes always match!  You can draw on the walls! And nobody yell at ya!  It was much easier to hit a baseball!  Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best.  Hey kids! Are those pterodactyl wings I hear 'a flappin'? I think I know who that is! Please welcome the Potty-dactyl!  Potty! Why aren't you wearing your costume?  I stayed up all night making it!  You're wasting your time, old man. Prehistoric stuff is lame. What?!  That's not true! Don't mind him, folks. Why even SpongeBob SquarePants knows that prehistoric stuff is, what the kids say,  cool.   Nope. He most certainly does. No he doesn't. Yes he does! No.  I know for a fact that he does! ...not. Meanwhile. SpongeBob! What's wrong?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't know, Mr. Krabs, but I've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me.  And the parrot is winning."}]}
